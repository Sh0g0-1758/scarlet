# Scarlet

Scarlet is a custom compiler developed in C++, designed with the primary goal of enhancing our understanding of compiler construction. The overarching objective is to implement an exceptionally fast machine learning framework built atop this compiler.

## Building Scarlet

To build Scarlet, invoke `cmake` with the `DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` flag within the build directory and then run make.

```sh
cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<compiler> ..
make
```

## Testing Scarlet

To test Scarlet, execute the following command within the build directory:

```sh
make test-scarlet
```

## Supported Architectures

Scarlet currently supports the following architectures:

| Operating System | Compiler | Supported Architectures |
| ---------------- | -------- | ----------------------- |
| Ubuntu           | GCC      | x86_64                  |
| Ubuntu           | Clang    | x86_64                  |
| macOS            | Clang    | ARM64                   |

## Roadmap

- [x] Implement a compiler driver with a custom lexer, parser, assembly generation pass, and code emission pass. (Note: We rely on GCC implementations for linking and preprocessing at this stage.)
- [x] Integrate Boost Program Options to replace manual handling of `argc` and `argv` functions.
- [x] (Lexer.cc) Find an alternative to erasing the `file_contents` text repeatedly.
- [x] (Parser.cc) Refactor every string to use enums.
- [x] Create a static library for the lexer, parser, and code generation components.
- [x] Add support for Unary Operations (Neg, Not)
- [x] Add support for Binary Operations (Add, Sub, Mul, Div, Rem)
- [x] Add support for Bitwise Binary Operations (And, Or, Xor, LeftShift, RightShift)
- [x] Add support for logical and relational operators (! && || == !=  < > <= >=)
- [x] Add support for user defined local variables
- [x] Add support for if-else construct
- [x] Add support for ternary operator
- [x] Add support for increment/decrement operator
- [x] Add support for compound operators (+=,-=,*=,/=,<<=,>>=,%=)
- [x] Add support for goto statement
- [x] Add support for compound statements
- [ ] Add support for Loops
- [ ] Add support for Functions
- [ ] Add support for static keyword and global scope
- [ ] Add support for Long Integers
- [ ] Add support for Unsigned Integers
- [ ] Add support for Floating-Point Numbers
- [ ] Add support for Pointers
- [ ] Add support for Arrays
- [ ] Add support for characters and strings
- [ ] Add support for dynamic memory allocation
- [ ] Add support for user defined structures
